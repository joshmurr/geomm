# GEOMM

A [~~soon to be~~] collection of composable function blocks for creative computing [one day].

This is largely a big playground for me to learn as I make. I'm trying to consolidate previous attempts at making flexible WebGL boilerplate libraries ([GL_BL](https://github.com/joshmurr/webgl_boilerplate), [GL-Handler](https://github.com/joshmurr/gl-handler)) and 3D graphics experiments into one network of packages. Whilst learning about functional programming methods in the process.

It is a very iterative process which normally starts with building an example...

```bash
./scripts/example.sh -n new-example
```

...and in making that example/demo finding features to add and ways to improve the API.

I'm not sure this will ever be done or useful for anyone other than me, but it's always good to experiment in public I think.

If it's not obvious this is heavily inspired by Karsten Schmidt's [thi.ng/umbrella](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella).
